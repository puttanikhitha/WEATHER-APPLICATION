# 🌤️ Pastel Weather — A Responsive Weather Web App

**Pastel Weather** is a responsive, user-friendly weather web application that provides real-time weather information and 5-day forecasts using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Designed with a clean pastel-themed UI and dynamic features, this project demonstrates API integration, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and responsive design principles.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible markup
